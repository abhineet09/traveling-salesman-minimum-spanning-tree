# traveling-salesman-minimum-spanning-tree

The project focused on solving the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) and generating Minimum Spanning Trees (MST) using approximation and brute force algorithms. The assignment was divided into three parts: an approximation algorithm for TSP, an optimal solution for TSP, and visualization of the results using Google Earth.
